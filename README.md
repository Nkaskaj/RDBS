# Forum flask-sqlalchemy

This is a basic Forum app built with Flask and PostgreSQL. The app provides users with the basic features like signing in, posting, rating or admin panel. It uses SQLAlchemy ORM models or you can use direct queries. It was my first project in Flask and HTML so there are a lot of clumsy CSS and code, so be ready.


## Tech ðŸ› 

**Framework:** Flask

**Database:** PostgreSQL


## Features âœ¨

- Changing ORM query or SQL query (execute)
- Singing up
- Posting (with picture)
- Replying to posts and comments
- Rating
- Changing email or password
- User's audits
- Changing roles of users
- A lot of SQL commands (Creating users, roles, granting, revoking...)
